# Git TDE

I'll give a quick overview of the Git CLI basics, some of my favorite tips and tricks, and hopefully this can lead to general sharing of Git CLI knowledge and questions.

An outline of what I've sketched out so far:
- Mirror Mirror -- cloning state via branches
- Where am I? -- `git log` commands
- Who am I? -- `git branch` commands
- What have I changed? -- `git status` and `git diff`
- Making it official -- `git add` and `git commit`
- Some MDE-specific tips and tricks -- rewriting history, kind of
- A few extra details -- resetting, rebasing, and stashing
